# GRAD Persistence (WIP)
GRAD Persistence will enable you to save/load:

* AI units
* vehicles
* static objects (including grad-fortifications)
* player equipment, inventory and health
* player money (needs grad-listBuymenu or grad-moneyMenu)

## Limitations
* magazines stored in containers refill
* weapon attachments on weapons in containers get removed from the weapon, but added to container cargo
* grad-fortifications owners are lost (--> you won't be able to pack up fortifications after loading - demolition works though)
